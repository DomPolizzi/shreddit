Welcome to shreddit !!!

Shreddit is more than just a site, more than just an idea or concept. Its a community, Linked not just digitally but physically. Connecting skaters of all sorts WORLD WIDE! Intergrating the functionality of multiple popular social networking sites, The main goal is Connectivity. Connectivity between artists. Whether it be enjoyment of just watching the sport(s), Recording it for someone else, or just enjoy skating...

Shreddits concept came to me out of frustration of being a boarder and no one to shred with or that would record during sessions. Years have gone by and I would like to say my flow is pretty sick, but theres no footage to really prove it...
