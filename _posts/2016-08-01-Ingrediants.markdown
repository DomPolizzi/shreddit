4 riders, 1 car, 4 skate, a bunch of wheels, medical kit, good music, reflex, gopro, pc, tents, itinerary and friendly locals to shred with.

Got everything? Ok, lets go and try to sk8 every single road and get some rad media out !!!

WARNING:
Watch out for the side effects…road rashes, time stress, laughing, loosing at least half of your stuff, camping everywhere…if you can get rid of this, you will probably end up with 3.000 km in 9 days through the North of Italy…amazing landscapes, crazy hairpins and racing an IDF event, such as Verdicchio Race.
You will meet every type of skilled riders…from little grooms to american legends… and you’ll be changed once back home…"
